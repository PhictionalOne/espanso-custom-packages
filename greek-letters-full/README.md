Based on the packages [Greek Letters: Upper and Lower](https://hub.espanso.org/packages/greek-letters/) and [Greek Letters alt](https://github.com/Su-Well/espanso-package-greek-letters)

# Reason

Why another Greek letters package? Great question! I found myself using greek letters quite frequently but also emojis like `:geek:` (ðŸ¤“). 
With Greek-Letters enabled I wasn't able to use `:geek:` as `:ge` replaced with less letters to `Îµ`.

Solution was to append the greek-letter-triggers with another `:`.

Also I somethimes forgot the letter corresponding to the symbol. So I decided to include @Su-Well's Greek Letters with the same modification as above.


# Usage

```
:gF:  â‡’ Î¦
:Phi: â‡’ Î¦
:gf:  â‡’ Ï† 
:phi: â‡’ Ï†
```

and that for the whole Alphabet.
